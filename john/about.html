        <h2>Hi, I'm John Ojukwu!</h2>
        <p>John O! was born from a simple school project — create a website to advertise a product. At first it was tough figuring out what to sell, so I did what any smart person would do: I looked it up! Cereal came up and it immediately clicked. The idea was alive.</p>
        <p>That's how <strong>John O!</strong> came to life — a wonderful cereal made with the finest grains of wheat, grown in the best soil, and crafted to be both <strong>very healthy</strong> and <strong>very tasty</strong>.</p>
        <p>And of course, no cereal brand is complete without a mascot. Meet <strong>Yellowy</strong> — the happy, hungry little guy who loves John O! just as much as you will!</p>
        <p class="opinions">Enjoy John O! and tell us your <strong>"O"pinions!</strong> 😄</p>
